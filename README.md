# Image Describer, Object Finder, and Object Tracker

This project consists of three modules that utilize the **Gemini-1.5-Flash** model to analyze and interact with images and videos:

1. **Image Description**: Describes the contents of an uploaded image.
2. **Object Finder**: Finds the location of a specific object in an image.
3. **Object Tracker**: Tracks an object in a video and timestamps when the object appears.

To begin, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/image-describer-object-finder-tracker.git
```
Before running the app, make sure you have the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install streamlit pillow google-generativeai
