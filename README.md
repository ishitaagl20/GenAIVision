# Image Describer, Object Finder, and Object Tracker

This project consists of three modules that utilize the **Gemini-1.5-Flash** model to analyze and interact with images and videos:

1. **Image Description**: Describes the contents of an uploaded image.
2. **Object Finder**: Finds the location of a specific object in an image.
3. **Object Tracker**: Tracks an object in a video and timestamps when the object appears.
